## Chat 1 to 1 AND Group Message
1. We have to create a template for a NON-GLOBAL chat.
2. We have to have the possibility to load all old message (We can load only N message when chat is open and a button to load old messages on top)
3. If we are the receiver we have to see the message in the left part of the screen, otherwise in the right part. (like the global chat)

### Group Chat
1. We have to have on top of the screen a toolbar where we can choose, for example, to add a member into a chat. 
2. We have to put in the menu an option where we can create a group

### 1-to-1 Chat
1. From the friendlist we can click on a button "chat" next to the contact name, we can create a chat in the main screen and then enter in that "room"
